# Assignments for the course Collecting Data at the University of Groningen

This is a README file of the added data in this repository. 
The data contains different notebooks of assignments for this course.
One of the notebooks includes an individual project in which I created a scraper for Reddit using Pushshift.io from the PSAW python library.
In this project I hope to create my own dataset which can give researchers insight in different narratives of Reddit user on History.


The data in this repository was for instructional purposes only. I published it to practice with github, git and the creation of an informatieve README file.
