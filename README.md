# Data: A little girls cookery book by Caroline French Benton

This is a README file of the added data in this repository. 
The data contains a .txt file which was obtained from the Project Gutenberg website. 
It is a digitalized version of the book "A little girl's cookery book" by Caroline French Benton. 
The book was written in 1905 but is still being sold today. 
It tells the narrative of young Margaret, a girl who really wants to learn how to cook. This book really combines the elements of storytelling and instruction in order to learn a young audience how to cook. 

The data in this repository was for instructional purposes only. I published it to practice with github, git and the creation of a informatieve README file.
